This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Project Description
This project uses https://newsapi.org to fetch news sources and their corresponding news list.
For the first time, It takes time to load each news list and source list. then it remembers the list and latter requests are returned from memory(so they are fast). It saves the current news in browser memory, so after closing and openning browser, it will remember the last news source and its list.

### How to run Project
firstly apply `npm install` to install dependencies. Then use `npm start` to run the project.
